        <p class="aboutMe">
          I'm Brendan, a 25-year-old originally from Virginia, but I now call
          Fort Worth my home. I proudly served in the US Army for six years
          being stationed in Colorado and Kansas. I have been self teaching
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the last few months. I am also certified
          in AWS Cloud Practioning and Professional Scrum Master I. My short
          term goal is to graduate from Code Fellows in March of 2024 and my
          long term goals are to become a successful Software Developer who is
          constantly learning and to be able to own a lot of land to where I can
          do whatever I want!
